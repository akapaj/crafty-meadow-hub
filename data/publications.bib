	abstract = {University campuses constitute highly complex architectural buildings with many entrance points, connection routes, confusing numbering and naming systems, lack of adequate signage, etc. These campuses deal with a high fluctuation of first time user groups such as new students and visitors that end up getting lost due to the lack of appropriate interactive campus routing systems. For effective and efficient indoor navigation systems cartographic principles related to map design and visualization should be utilized. However, indoor cartography is still a “territory to be discovered”.
This thesis illustrates how a cartographically appealing campus routing system that facilitates the navigation process of various user groups in complex university campuses can be designed and developed. The main criteria for an interactive 3D web application that combines the visualization of indoor spaces for an effective and user-friendly route planning and route communication are outlined. As a case study for this thesis, the main building of the Technical University of Munich main campus is used. An exemplary workflow from the raw data, to the campus basemap and finally to a fully interactive 3D routing published as a web application is described.
To investigate the cartographic design and visualization methods applied to the developed campus routing system, two user evaluations were designed and conducted. The first user evaluation focused on campus map design and the visualization of interior spaces. This evaluation used an expert-based method to gather feedback from experienced user in the field of map design and visualization techniques. The second user study was conducted to evaluate the usability and utility of the developed campus routing system, by measuring its effectiveness, efficiency and users’ satisfaction. A user-based method was applied for this evaluation and first time visitors were chosen as the target group for this evaluation.
According to the results gathered from these two user studies, it can be concluded that a campus routing system makes use of structural indoor features to plan and convey the route in an effective and efficient way. Users stated that they were satisfied with the developed 3D web application and would like to use it for other university campuses.},

	abstract = {Even though they are day-to-day activities, humans find navigation and wayfinding to be cognitively challenging. To facilitate their everyday mobility, humans increasingly rely on ubiquitous mobile maps as navigation aids. However, the over-reliance on and habitual use of omnipresent navigation aids deteriorate humans' short-term ability to learn new information about their surroundings and induces a long-term decline in spatial skills. This deterioration in spatial learning is attributed to the fact that these aids capture users' attention and cause them to enter a passive navigation mode. Another factor that limits spatial learning during map-aided navigation is the lack of salient landmark information on mobile maps.

Prior research has already demonstrated that wayfinders rely on landmarks—geographic features that stand out from their surroundings—to facilitate navigation and build a spatial representation of the environments they traverse. Landmarks serve as anchor points and help wayfinders to visually match the spatial information depicted on the mobile map with the information collected during the active exploration of the environment. Considering the acknowledged significance of landmarks for human wayfinding due to their visibility and saliency, this thesis investigates an open research question: how to graphically communicate landmarks on mobile map aids to cue wayfinders' allocation of attentional resources to these task-relevant environmental features. From a cartographic design perspective, landmarks can be depicted on mobile map aids on a graphical continuum ranging from abstract 2D text labels to realistic 3D buildings with high visual fidelity. Based on the importance of landmarks for human wayfinding and the rich cartographic body of research concerning their depiction on mobile maps, this thesis investigated how various landmark visualization styles affect the navigation process of two user groups (expert and general wayfinders) in different navigation use contexts (emergency and general navigation tasks). Specifically, I conducted two real-world map-aided navigation studies to assess the influence of various landmark visualization styles on wayfinders' navigation performance, spatial learning, allocation of visual attention, and cognitive load.

In Study I, I investigated how depicting landmarks as abstract 2D building footprints or realistic 3D buildings on the mobile map affected expert wayfinders' navigation performance, visual attention, spatial learning, and cognitive load during an emergency navigation task. I asked expert navigators recruited from the Swiss Armed Forces to follow a predefined route using a mobile map depicting landmarks as either abstract 2D building footprints or realistic 3D buildings and to identify the depicted task-relevant landmarks in the environment. I recorded the experts' gaze behavior with a mobile eye-tracer and their cognitive load with EEG during the navigation task, and I captured their incidental spatial learning at the end of the task. The wayfinding experts' exhibited high navigation performance and low cognitive load during the map-aided navigation task regardless of the landmark visualization style. Their gaze behavior revealed that wayfinding experts navigating with realistic 3D landmarks focused more on the visualizations of landmarks on the mobile map than those who navigated with abstract 2D landmarks, while the latter focused more on the depicted route. Furthermore, when the experts focused for longer on the environment and the landmarks, their spatial learning improved regardless of the landmark visualization style. I also found that the spatial learning of experts with self-reported low spatial abilities improved when they navigated with landmarks depicted as realistic 3D buildings.

In Study II, I investigated the influence of abstract and realistic 3D landmark visualization styles on wayfinders sampled from the general population. As in Study I, I investigated wayfinders' navigation performance, visual attention, spatial learning, and cognitive load. In contrast to Study I, the participants in Study II were exposed to both landmark visualization styles in a navigation context that mimics everyday navigation. Furthermore, the participants were informed that their spatial knowledge of the environment would be tested after navigation. As in Study I, the wayfinders in Study II exhibited high navigation performance and low cognitive load regardless of the landmark visualization style. Their visual attention revealed that wayfinders with low spatial abilities and wayfinders familiar with the study area fixated on the environment longer when they navigated with realistic 3D landmarks on the mobile map. Spatial learning improved when wayfinders with low spatial abilities were assisted by realistic 3D landmarks. Also, when wayfinders were assisted by realistic 3D landmarks and paid less attention to the map aid, their spatial learning improved.

Taken together, the present real-world navigation studies provide ecologically valid results on the influence of various landmark visualization styles on wayfinders. In particular, the studies demonstrate how visualization style modulates wayfinders' visual attention and facilitates spatial learning across various user groups and navigation use contexts. Furthermore, the results of both studies highlight the importance of individual differences in spatial abilities as predictors of spatial learning during map-assisted navigation. Based on these findings, the present work provides design recommendations for future mobile maps that go beyond the traditional concept of  "one fits all." Indeed, the studies support the cause for landmark depiction that directs individual wayfinders' visual attention to task-relevant landmarks to further enhance spatial learning. This would be especially helpful for users with low spatial skills. In doing so, future mobile maps could dynamically adapt the visualization style of landmarks according to wayfinders' spatial abilities for cued visual attention, thus meeting individuals' spatial learning needs.},

How to effectively visualize landmarks to support spatial learning during map-assisted pedestrian navigation is still an open question. We thus set out to assess how landmark visualization styles (i.e., abstract 2D vs. realistic 3D) influence map-assisted spatial learning of expert wayfinders in an outdoor navigation study. Below we report on how the visualization of landmarks on mobile maps might influence wayfinder’s gaze behavior while trying to find a set of landmarks along a given route in an unfamiliar environment. We find that navigators assisted with mobile maps showing realistic-looking 3D landmarks more equally share their visual attention on task-relevant information, while those assisted with maps containing abstract 2D landmarks frequently switch their visual attention between the visualized landmarks and the mobile map to complete the navigation task. The presented analysis approach for the assessment of wayfinder’s gaze patterns has the potential to contribute ecologically valid insights for the understanding of human visual attention allocation during outdoor navigation, and to further understand how landmark depiction styles on mobile maps might guide wayfinders’ visual attention back to the environment to support spatial learning during map-assisted navigation.},

	abstract = {Humans increasingly rely on GPS-enabled mobile maps to navigate novel environments. However, this reliance can negatively affect spatial learning, which can be detrimental even for expert navigators such as search and rescue personnel. Landmark visualization has been shown to improve spatial learning in general populations by facilitating object identification between the map and the environment. How landmark visualization supports expert users’ spatial learning during map-assisted navigation is still an open research question. We thus conducted a real-world study with wayfinding experts in an unknown residential neighborhood. We aimed to assess how two different landmark visualization styles (abstract 2D vs. realistic 3D buildings) would affect experts’ spatial learning in a map-assisted navigation task during an emergency scenario. Using a between-subjects design, we asked Swiss military personnel to follow a given route using a mobile map, and to identify five task-relevant landmarks along the route. We recorded experts’ gaze behavior while navigating and examined their spatial learning after the navigation task. We found that experts’ spatial learning improved when they focused their visual attention on the environment, but the direction of attention between the map and the environment was not affected by the landmark visualization style. Further, there was no difference in spatial learning between the 2D and 3D groups. Contrary to previous research with general populations, this study suggests that the landmark visualization style does not enhance expert navigators’ navigation or spatial learning abilities, thus highlighting the need for population-specific mobile map design solutions.},

Recently, the ubiquity of this serial position effect has been supported for objects learned during navigation, with canonical serial position functions observed for sequence memory of landmarks that were encountered along a route during a highly controlled virtual navigation task. In the present study, we extended those findings to a real-world navigation task in which participants actively walked a route through a city whilst using a navigation aid featuring either realistic or abstract landmark visualisation styles. Analyses of serial position functions (i.e., absolute sequence knowledge) and sequence lags (i.e., relative sequence knowledge) yielded similar profiles to those observed in a lab based virtual navigation task from previous work and non-spatial list learning studies. There were strong primacy effects for serial position memory in both conditions; recency effects only in the realistic visualisation condition; a non-uniform distribution of item-lags peaking at lag +1; and an overall bias towards positive lags for both visualisation conditions. The findings demonstrate that benchmark serial position memory effects can be observed in uncontrolled, real-world behaviour. In a navigation context, the results support the notion that general memory mechanisms are involved in spatial learning, and that landmark sequence knowledge is a feature of spatial knowledge which is affected by navigation aids.},

 abstract = {An often-proposed enhancement for mobile maps to aid assisted navigation is the presentation of landmark information, yet understanding of the manner in which they should be displayed is limited. In this study, we investigated whether the visualization of landmarks as 3D map symbols with either an abstract or realistic style influenced the subsequent processing of those landmarks during route navigation. We utilized a real-world mobile electroencephalography approach to this question by combining several tools developed to overcome the challenges typically encountered in real-world neuroscience research. We coregistered eye-movement and EEG recordings from 45 participants as they navigated through a real-world environment using a mobile map. Analyses of fixation event-related potentials revealed that the amplitude of the parietal P200 component was enhanced when participants fixated landmarks in the real world that were visualized on the mobile map in a realistic style, and that frontal P200 latencies were prolonged for landmarks depicted in either a realistic or abstract style compared with features of the environment that were not presented on the map, but only for the male participants. In contrast, we did not observe any significant effects of landmark visualization style on visual P1-N1 peaks or the parietal late positive component. Overall, the findings indicate that the cognitive matching process between landmarks seen in the environment and those previously seen on a map is facilitated by more realistic map display, while low-level perceptual processing of landmarks and recall of associated information are unaffected by map visualization style.},

 abstract = {Background: Featuring landmarks on navigation aids is one method proposed to improve wayfinding outcomes. However, there is little attention given to the how the depiction of specific features of landmarks on mobile-maps modulate attention and spatial learning during navigation. Aims: In the present study, we aimed to assess how the provision of realistic landmark symbols on a mobile-map, compared to abstract symbols, affected the processing of relevant information during navigation, and the acquisition of spatial knowledge. Methods: Fortysix participants navigated a route in the real world prescribed via a mobile-map. The map featured 3D landmark symbols in either realistic or abstract formats. We recorded eye-movements and electroencephalography (EEG) throughout and administered postnavigation tests of spatial knowledge. Results: Subjects spent more time attending to the environment during portions of the route that had realistic landmark symbols on the map, although this effect was modulated by self-reported spatial ability. Lower-ability subjects spent more time attending to task-relevant landmarks that had realistic symbols, whereas higher-ability subjects spent more time attending to the whole environment in general. Interestingly, this did not result in improved explicit spatial knowledge for the realistic landmarks. However, examination of EEG fixation-related-potentials revealed an enhanced P200 amplitude for realistically displayed landmarks, signifying improved implicit recognition and perceptual matching of real-world landmarks to their map symbol counterparts. Conclusion: Visualising landmarks as realistic compared to abstract symbols benefits the direction of visual attention towards, and implicit recognition of, important information during navigation. However, this does not result in improved explicit spatial knowledge.},

 abstract = {Background: Longitudinal studies assessing long-term spatial memory retention for real-world navigation tasks, aided by mobile maps enriched with landmark information, are scarce. Because the importance of landmarks for navigation and spatial learning has been wellestablished, landmark depiction on ubiquitous mobile maps has become popular to counter the negative influence mobile map aids have on short- and long-term spatial memory formation and retention. Aims: This longitudinal study assesses the long-term retention of landmark and route knowledge of participants who took part in a previous real-world map-aided navigation study. Methods: The initial study used a within-subject design with the landmark visualization style as the independent variable. Ten task-relevant landmarks were saliently depicted on the map as realistic or abstract 3D symbols. Forty-six participants were asked to navigate a 1 km real-world route with the map aid once. Of those, 25 participants returned for the present follow-up study (mean delay = 725.2 ± 15.77 days). We assessed their long-term retention of landmark and route knowledge about the route traversed in the initial study. Results: Returning participants performed above chance level on the landmark and route knowledge tests, showing long-term retention of spatial knowledge. Repeated-measure ANOVAs within the visualization condition and retention interval revealed that regardless of the visualization condition, landmark knowledge decreased over the retention period as expected, while, surprisingly, route knowledge was unaffected. Conclusion: These results contribute to a better understanding of spatial memory formation and long-term retention after a single route exposure aided by a mobile map enriched with salient landmarks.},
