abstract: 'Background: Longitudinal studies assessing long-term spatial memory retention
  for real-world navigation tasks, aided by mobile maps enriched with landmark information,
  are scarce. Because the importance of landmarks for navigation and spatial learning
  has been wellestablished, landmark depiction on ubiquitous mobile maps has become
  popular to counter the negative influence mobile map aids have on short- and long-term
  spatial memory formation and retention. Aims: This longitudinal study assesses the
  long-term retention of landmark and route knowledge of participants who took part
  in a previous real-world map-aided navigation study. Methods: The initial study
  used a within-subject design with the landmark visualization style as the independent
  variable. Ten task-relevant landmarks were saliently depicted on the map as realistic
  or abstract 3D symbols. Forty-six participants were asked to navigate a 1 km real-world
  route with the map aid once. Of those, 25 participants returned for the present
  follow-up study (mean delay = 725.2 ± 15.77 days). We assessed their long-term retention
  of landmark and route knowledge about the route traversed in the initial study.
  Results: Returning participants performed above chance level on the landmark and
  route knowledge tests, showing long-term retention of spatial knowledge. Repeated-measure
  ANOVAs within the visualization condition and retention interval revealed that regardless
  of the visualization condition, landmark knowledge decreased over the retention
  period as expected, while, surprisingly, route knowledge was unaffected. Conclusion:
  These results contribute to a better understanding of spatial memory formation and
  long-term retention after a single route exposure aided by a mobile map enriched
  with salient landmarks.'
