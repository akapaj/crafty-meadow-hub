abstract: The visualization of landmarks in mobile maps has become a popular countermeasure
  to the negative effect navigation aids have on spatial learning. Landmarks are salient
  environmental cues that serve as cognitive anchors during navigation, facilitating
  spatial memory formation and long-term retention. However, longitudinal studies
  assessing long-term spatial memory retention acquired during mobile map-assisted
  navigation in the real world and what role visualized landmarks play in this context
  are still scarce. We report on a longitudinal study to assess long-term spatial
  memory retention of wayfinders who, two years prior, navigated only once a real-world
  route prescribed with a mobile map aid enriched with visually salient task-relevant
  landmarks. We report preliminary results on their long-term memory retention of
  acquired landmark and route knowledge. We found that participants retained meaningful
  long-term landmark and route knowledge over the two-year study period. While landmark
  knowledge decreased over the test-retest sessions, gained route knowledge was unaffected.
  These ecologically valid results contribute to a better understanding of spatial
  memory formation and long-term retention after one route exposure through a real-world
  environment, aided by a mobile map enriched with salient landmarks.
