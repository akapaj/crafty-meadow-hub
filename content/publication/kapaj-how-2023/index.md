abstract: Humans increasingly rely on GPS-enabled mobile maps to navigate novel environments.
  However, this reliance can negatively affect spatial learning, which can be detrimental
  even for expert navigators such as search and rescue personnel. Landmark visualization
  has been shown to improve spatial learning in general populations by facilitating
  object identification between the map and the environment. How landmark visualization
  supports expert users’ spatial learning during map-assisted navigation is still
  an open research question. We thus conducted a real-world study with wayfinding
  experts in an unknown residential neighborhood. We aimed to assess how two different
  landmark visualization styles (abstract 2D vs. realistic 3D buildings) would affect
  experts’ spatial learning in a map-assisted navigation task during an emergency
  scenario. Using a between-subjects design, we asked Swiss military personnel to
  follow a given route using a mobile map, and to identify five task-relevant landmarks
  along the route. We recorded experts’ gaze behavior while navigating and examined
  their spatial learning after the navigation task. We found that experts’ spatial
  learning improved when they focused their visual attention on the environment, but
  the direction of attention between the map and the environment was not affected
  by the landmark visualization style. Further, there was no difference in spatial
  learning between the 2D and 3D groups. Contrary to previous research with general
  populations, this study suggests that the landmark visualization style does not
  enhance expert navigators’ navigation or spatial learning abilities, thus highlighting
  the need for population-specific mobile map design solutions.
