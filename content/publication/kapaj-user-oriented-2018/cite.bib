 abstract = {University campuses constitute highly complex architectural buildings with many entrance points, connection routes, confusing numbering and naming systems, lack of adequate signage, etc. These campuses deal with a high fluctuation of first time user groups such as new students and visitors that end up getting lost due to the lack of appropriate interactive campus routing systems. For effective and efficient indoor navigation systems cartographic principles related to map design and visualization should be utilized. However, indoor cartography is still a “territory to be discovered”.
This thesis illustrates how a cartographically appealing campus routing system that facilitates the navigation process of various user groups in complex university campuses can be designed and developed. The main criteria for an interactive 3D web application that combines the visualization of indoor spaces for an effective and user-friendly route planning and route communication are outlined. As a case study for this thesis, the main building of the Technical University of Munich main campus is used. An exemplary workflow from the raw data, to the campus basemap and finally to a fully interactive 3D routing published as a web application is described.
To investigate the cartographic design and visualization methods applied to the developed campus routing system, two user evaluations were designed and conducted. The first user evaluation focused on campus map design and the visualization of interior spaces. This evaluation used an expert-based method to gather feedback from experienced user in the field of map design and visualization techniques. The second user study was conducted to evaluate the usability and utility of the developed campus routing system, by measuring its effectiveness, efficiency and users’ satisfaction. A user-based method was applied for this evaluation and first time visitors were chosen as the target group for this evaluation.
According to the results gathered from these two user studies, it can be concluded that a campus routing system makes use of structural indoor features to plan and convey the route in an effective and efficient way. Users stated that they were satisfied with the developed 3D web application and would like to use it for other university campuses.},
