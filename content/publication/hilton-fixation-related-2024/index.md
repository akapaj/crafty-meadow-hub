abstract: An often-proposed enhancement for mobile maps to aid assisted navigation
  is the presentation of landmark information, yet understanding of the manner in
  which they should be displayed is limited. In this study, we investigated whether
  the visualization of landmarks as 3D map symbols with either an abstract or realistic
  style influenced the subsequent processing of those landmarks during route navigation.
  We utilized a real-world mobile electroencephalography approach to this question
  by combining several tools developed to overcome the challenges typically encountered
  in real-world neuroscience research. We coregistered eye-movement and EEG recordings
  from 45 participants as they navigated through a real-world environment using a
  mobile map. Analyses of fixation event-related potentials revealed that the amplitude
  of the parietal P200 component was enhanced when participants fixated landmarks
  in the real world that were visualized on the mobile map in a realistic style, and
  that frontal P200 latencies were prolonged for landmarks depicted in either a realistic
  or abstract style compared with features of the environment that were not presented
  on the map, but only for the male participants. In contrast, we did not observe
  any significant effects of landmark visualization style on visual P1-N1 peaks or
  the parietal late positive component. Overall, the findings indicate that the cognitive
  matching process between landmarks seen in the environment and those previously
  seen on a map is facilitated by more realistic map display, while low-level perceptual
  processing of landmarks and recall of associated information are unaffected by map
  visualization style.
