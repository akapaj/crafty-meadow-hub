abstract: 'Background: Featuring landmarks on navigation aids is one method proposed
  to improve wayfinding outcomes. However, there is little attention given to the
  how the depiction of specific features of landmarks on mobile-maps modulate attention
  and spatial learning during navigation. Aims: In the present study, we aimed to
  assess how the provision of realistic landmark symbols on a mobile-map, compared
  to abstract symbols, affected the processing of relevant information during navigation,
  and the acquisition of spatial knowledge. Methods: Fortysix participants navigated
  a route in the real world prescribed via a mobile-map. The map featured 3D landmark
  symbols in either realistic or abstract formats. We recorded eye-movements and electroencephalography
  (EEG) throughout and administered postnavigation tests of spatial knowledge. Results:
  Subjects spent more time attending to the environment during portions of the route
  that had realistic landmark symbols on the map, although this effect was modulated
  by self-reported spatial ability. Lower-ability subjects spent more time attending
  to task-relevant landmarks that had realistic symbols, whereas higher-ability subjects
  spent more time attending to the whole environment in general. Interestingly, this
  did not result in improved explicit spatial knowledge for the realistic landmarks.
  However, examination of EEG fixation-related-potentials revealed an enhanced P200
  amplitude for realistically displayed landmarks, signifying improved implicit recognition
  and perceptual matching of real-world landmarks to their map symbol counterparts.
  Conclusion: Visualising landmarks as realistic compared to abstract symbols benefits
  the direction of visual attention towards, and implicit recognition of, important
  information during navigation. However, this does not result in improved explicit
  spatial knowledge.'
