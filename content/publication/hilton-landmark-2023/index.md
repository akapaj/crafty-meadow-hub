abstract: Primacy and recency features of serial memory are a hallmark of typical
  memory functions that have been observed for a wide array of tasks. Recently, the
  ubiquity of this serial position effect has been supported for objects learned during
  navigation, with canonical serial position functions observed for sequence memory
  of landmarks that were encountered along a route during a highly controlled virtual
  navigation task. In the present study, we extended those findings to a real-world
  navigation task in which participants actively walked a route through a city whilst
  using a navigation aid featuring either realistic or abstract landmark visualisation
  styles. Analyses of serial position functions (i.e., absolute sequence knowledge)
  and sequence lags (i.e., relative sequence knowledge) yielded similar profiles to
  those observed in a lab based virtual navigation task from previous work and non-spatial
  list learning studies. There were strong primacy effects for serial position memory
  in both conditions; recency effects only in the realistic visualisation condition;
  a non-uniform distribution of item-lags peaking at lag +1; and an overall bias towards
  positive lags for both visualisation conditions. The findings demonstrate that benchmark
  serial position memory effects can be observed in uncontrolled, real-world behaviour.
  In a navigation context, the results support the notion that general memory mechanisms
  are involved in spatial learning, and that landmark sequence knowledge is a feature
  of spatial knowledge which is affected by navigation aids.
